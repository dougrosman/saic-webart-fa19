####  Homework:

### _Net Art Oral Presentation_ ####
__TL;DR: By Monday 09/09, pick two artists and works and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vdFCXMbA0mN2oKW-Y_oQW-1tXE1L4_r30MJCHNqAZk/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">POST THEM ON THIS GOOGLE DOC</a>. By Wednesday 09/11, finish your website so that you can present from it. We'll work on our websites together in class on Monday 09/09__

##### Summary:
Craft a 6-8 minute oral presentation on two works of net.art from Rhizome's <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org" target="blank"> NET ART ANTHOLOGY </a>.

##### Description:
There's so much to learn about the web—how does it work? How do we develop for it? How has it shaped our culture? etc.

Web artists confront all these questions (and more) in a variety of ways, so why not learn about the web through the art that's been made with it/on it/about it?

As a quick way to scratch the surface of net.art's history, each of you will present on two net.art/web artists and art works. These brief presentations are designed to emphasize a broad exposure to topics and artists we'll explore more deeply throughout the semester.

Rhizome.org's recently-completed <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org" target="blank"> NET ART ANTHOLOGY </a> is a great place to find works, as well as information about them. You are not limited to this repository for finding net.art works; feel free to look elsewhere, or present on a favorite work you might already have!

##### Requirements:
1. __Due Monday 09/09:__ Select two artists and a work from each artist for your presentation, and  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vdFCXMbA0mN2oKW-Y_oQW-1tXE1L4_r30MJCHNqAZk/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">POST THEM ON THIS GOOGLE DOC</a>. (You may not choose an artist or work that somebody else has already chosen, so the sooner you post here, the better chance you'll have to present on the artists/works you want! (Follow my example on the Google Doc))
2. __Due Wednesday 09/11:__ Your "_presentation website_." We're going to skip the usual Powerpoint presentation and make websites to present from! Just some simple HTML/CSS. __We will work on these in class on Monday, 09/09.__
* __minimum requirements:__
    * 3 pages (a home page, a page for artist/work 1, a page for artist/work 2)
    * Each page links to each other page
    * Links to the works about which you are presenting.
    * text and images on each page, enough stuff for you to talk about for 6-8 minutes.
    * the website is hosted on GitHub Pages
3. __Due Wednesday 09/11:__ The presentation itself! You'll be reading off of/showing images from the website you create. Here are some questions to guide your presentation/things you might want to include for each artist/work:
    * Artist Name/where they are based
    * Work Name/year it was created
    * Images of the work
    * How is the website designed/how does it work?
    * How is the artist using the web for this work?
    * How/why is the web integral to this work as a medium? Put another way, could this work exist without the Internet?
    * Why did you pick it?

*Phew*. That's a lot.
__TL;DR: By Monday 09/09, pick two artists and works and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vdFCXMbA0mN2oKW-Y_oQW-1tXE1L4_r30MJCHNqAZk/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">POST THEM ON THIS GOOGLE DOC</a>.

__(Reminder):__
    1. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line" target="blank">Command Line lessons 1-3 on Code Academy</a> (__due: 09/09__)
    2. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git" target="blank">git lessons 1-4 on Code Academy</a> (__due: 09/09__)
    * _Note 1: when you first create an account on Code Academy, it'll put you in the 7-day trial of a "Pro" account. Don't worry, all the lessons on CodeAcademy are free even after that expires. Pro just offers extra features we won't need._
    * _Note 2: You're likely to have tons of questions about these! If you feel like you're struggling with these tutorials, fret not! We'll go over it in class on 09/09 when I'm back. The things in these tutorials will be repeated throughout the semester, so you'll have plenty of time to get comfortable with them :)_
