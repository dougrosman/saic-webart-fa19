## Assignment:
#### Due Monday 09/30:
1. CSS Animations: "Loading Bar" _OR_ "petting zoo":
    Using CSS animations, you have two options for an assignment to complete by Monday. **Just do one of them. _Your page should be uploaded to your GitHub. Once there, DM me in Slack a link to the webpage before class Monday._**
2. Find **two** artist websites. Post links to the sites in the Slack <a href="https://saic-webart-fa19.slack.com/messages/CMVBT9RGX" target="blank"># artists-artworks-websites</a> channel. Focus on finding websites that you find interesting, or that you think compliment the artist's portfolio. This isn't about showing your favorite artist and their work (although if your favorite artist has a cool website, great!). We'll take a look at these in class on Monday (don't worry, no presentations :P)

#### 1. An animated loading bar
CSS keyframe animations and transitions provide a number of ways to manipulate shapes, text, images and other objects on your web page. Using the animation properties we went over in class (changing size, position, color, etc.) as well as other properties you might find online, create your own interpretation of a <a href="https://giphy.com/search/loading-bar" target="_blank">loading bar</a>.

Loading bars exist to comfort us that progress is being made with some process. Often they are accurate; often they are totally arbitrary and meaningless. The loading bar is an in-between device, something to sit through before getting to the _content_. With this assignment, subvert the original function of the loading bar, and make _it_ the content!
##### Guidelines:
1. Use a combination of CSS animations or transitions.
1. No traditional bar-moving-from-left-to-right. Come up with your own unconventional way of visualizing "progress"
1. Consider: what personality does your loading bar have? How might it call attention to our awareness of the passage of time? Do you want to build tension, or craft a calm, predictable loading experience? Will it ever fully load?
1. Consider: Does it use images, shapes, language, numbers? A combination of these things? Is it tiny, or does it take up the whole page?

### OR

#### 2. An animated "petting zoo"
Using CSS keyframe animations and transitions, create a "petting zoo", where animals–in the form of images or CSS shapes–roam around a "pen" (check out a guide to making shapes in CSS <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/" target="blank">here</a>). These animals will behave in certain ways based on your animations.
##### Guidelines:
1. Use a combination of CSS animations or transitions.
1. Demonstrate a certain level of "complexity" This could mean having multiple "animals" with simple animations, or 1 or 2 animals with more elaborate animations.
1. Create a space for these "animals" to roam. No blank web-page!
1. Consider: what story are you trying to tell with these animals? Are these creatures we've seen before, or entirely new species?
1. Consider: are you animating CSS objects like a &lt;div&gt;? Are you pulling pictures of actual animals from the internet? Are you literally making a &lt;p&gt; tag of the word "goat" and having just text roam around the pen? Do whatever!
