## Today's code
<a href="https://dougrosman.github.io/saic-webart-fa19/code/session07/flexbox-inclass.html" target="_blank">TODAY'S FLEX BOX CODE </a>

## Resources:
<a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox" target="_blank">Free Code Camp Flex Box Tutorials</a>

## Flex Box:
```
display: flex;
flex-direction: row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse;
    * default is row;
justify-content: center, flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around;
align-items: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch;
flex-wrap: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse;
flex-shrink: num;
flex-grow: num;
flex-basis: em/px/%/auto;
order: num;
align-self: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch;

```

These values will cause #box-1to grow to fill the extra space at twice the rate of #box-2when the container is greater than 300px and shrink at twice the rate of #box-2when the container is less than 300px. 300px is the combined size of the flex-basisvalues of the two boxes.

## Questions
1. When did the 404 Page Not Found Error start appearing on the internet?  (https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/the-404-not-found-error-page-has-origins-dating-back-to-the-1980s/news-story/c30a3488e240067204fbcc0155dcbabe)
2. How much can we trust the Internet?
3. In Long Live the Web: A Call for Continued Open Standards and Neutrality, it writes about Chinese government violates the network right from their citizens, and also attempted to hack in Google’s database to get the information of the dissidents. How can government restrict their nation’s internet? how does it work to create a closed-world? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall#Blocking_methods)
4. As human beings, are we at a point in time that we have become the data? are we walking data?
5. outside of nostalgia why is the 1.0 era so important to so many people today?
(https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/)
6. For those that grew up creating personalized webpages and social media profiles, how did thay personally make you feel? Is creating a personal webpage almost like creating a representation of yourself online that needs to be performed in some way?
7. I found this quote really interesting: “First of all, because it is an expression of a dislike, when today there is only an opportunity to like” ( about the peeing man). I was really curious to know if people in the class agreed with the second half of the statement, and more importantly why. 
8. Can copyright laws negatively interfere with free speech online? https://archive.org/details/InformationDoesntWantToBeFree
9. In the Tumblr example,  it says "people should greet the new feature, they should experience satisfaction with every update!" Isn't this another form of "bad" experience? Just different words force people to agree on something.  What if people can choose to not agree and click "No it's not fine." Is this a better user experience?
