# Web Development Resources

Here's a list of web development and creative coding resources. I'll be adding to this over time!

#### Stuff for our class
* <a href="gitguide" target="blank">GitHub Guide</a>
* <a href="customDomain" target="blank">Link a Custom Domain to your GitHub Pages</a>

#### General Coding
* <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a> – Great guided tutorials in HTML/CSS/Javascript and more
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="blank">The Coding Train (YouTube Channel)</a> – The Coding Train covers A TON of creative coding topics, mostly for P5.js, but there's some basic web stuff in there too.
* <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/30-css-best-practices-for-beginners--net-6741" target="blank">30 CSS Best Practices for Beginners</a> – Just some good tips for once you get a bit more comfortable with your code.

#### CSS Tools
* <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com" target="blank">Cubic Bezier Curve Generator</a> – Create and test out animation timings/easings in real time using Cubic Bezier Curves!
* <a href="http://learnlayout.com/position.html" target="blank">Learn CSS Layout</a> – In order to make more complex layouts, we need to discuss the position property. It has a bunch of possible values, and their names make no sense and are impossible to remember.

#### Creative Tutorials!
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqc149iR-ALYkGM6TG-7vQ" target="blank"> Frank's Laboratory (YouTube Channel) </a> – I haven't done many of these, but these somewhat advanced tutorials look great for "Pure CSS" and vanilla Javascript animations.


#### PROFPRACKY Talks and other stuff you should watch
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whPWKecazgM" target="blank"> World Building in Blender – Ian Hubert </a> – This is a talk by a professional VFX artist who works almost exclusively with the free, open source 3D software Blender. He does the 1-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_c58ryJ-Sw" target="blank">Lazy Blender Tutorials</a> (which you should more/all of!). I recommend watching the whole 30+ minutes of the talk. Even if you aren't a 3D artist (I'm not), I think his journey through learning the tools in a way that worked for him, and eventually working in a pretty competitive industry, can translate to whatever specific field you're working in. He's also pretty entertaining so it's a fun talk to watch.

* <a href="https://youtu.be/IoRV6UBFSRM?t=73" target="blank">VFX Artists React to Bad & Great CGi 13</a> – we watched a portion of this in class. The whole 20 minute video is an entertaining diversion, but the "#PROFPRAC" part starts around 1:13 and goes for a couple minutes. In that part, the guest artist talks about his process of "sketching" out the music video he's going to make by shooting a crappy iphone version he calls the "crap-o-matic." Even if you aren't working in film, I think this is an example of an incredibly useful process for developing any idea/project. The "crap-o-matic" version does two things: it helps you pitch your idea to people who might not have good imaginations* (like submitting grant or exhibition proposals), and it guides you in the actual _making_ of your project (you might realize something is impossible before doing a ton of work to get to that point, or you might find a shortcut!)

    *_I worked briefly at a production company in Hollywood that specialized in producing unique stunts, events and "activations" to market movies and TV shows. These stunts went beyond your traditional movie trailers, billboards and bus stop ads. We had to make "pitch decks" for all the ideas we thought would interest a movie studio. These decks were easily digestible Powerpoint slideshows that we would send to the studios as PDFs. Our ideas were often outlandish and unique, so we had to do our best to communicate our ideas in understandable language. My boss/the CEO always said: "these studio people don't have imaginations, and if they do, pretend like they don't." (or something like that, I'm paraphrasing). The point is, even in a creative industry, you can't trust people to understand the thing you're pitching. It's mostly that they're busy and don't want to expend extra brain power to interpret your vague language and diagrams. The crap-o-matic technique above is a useful tactic for something you might be proposing (though keep in mind, the crap-o-matic still takes a certain amount of work on its own!)_
