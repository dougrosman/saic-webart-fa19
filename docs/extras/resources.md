# Web Development Resources

Here's a list of web development and creative coding resources. I'll be adding to this over time!

#### Stuff for our class
* <a href="gitguide.md" target="blank">GitHub Guide</a>

#### General Coding
* <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a> – Great guided tutorials in HTML/CSS/Javascript and more
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="blank">The Coding Train (YouTube Channel)</a> – The Coding Train covers A TON of creative coding topics, mostly for P5.js, but there's some basic web stuff in there too.
* <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/30-css-best-practices-for-beginners--net-6741" target="blank">30 CSS Best Practices for Beginners</a> – Just some good tips for once you get a bit more comfortable with your code.

#### CSS Tools
* <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com" target="blank">Cubic Bezier Curve Generator</a> – Create and test out animation timings/easings in real time using Cubic Bezier Curves!
* <a href="http://learnlayout.com/position.html" target="blank">Learn CSS Layout</a> – In order to make more complex layouts, we need to discuss the position property. It has a bunch of possible values, and their names make no sense and are impossible to remember.

#### Creative Tutorials!
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqc149iR-ALYkGM6TG-7vQ" target="blank"> Frank's Laboratory (YouTube Channel) </a> – I haven't done many of these, but these somewhat advanced tutorials look great for "Pure CSS" and vanilla Javascript animations.
