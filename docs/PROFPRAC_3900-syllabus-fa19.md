### COURSE DESCRIPTION
**_Professional Practice: Web Art_** is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of web art. Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well as additional languages like CSS and Javascript to build varied websites. Potential overall format and conceptual frameworks for developing a media-rich website will be investigated, and ways of subverting the traditional web page format in order to create unique approaches to the dynamics of the web will be explored. Course activities include technical tutorials, preparing a résumé and CV, writing a project statement, creating a website, and critiquing projects.

### COURSE GOALS
##### KEY GOALS INCLUDE:
* Implement a well-planned creative project, applying professional skills relevant to your artistic, creative, and/or scholarly practice.
* Present a professional body of work in an online context, demonstrating a critical awareness of audience and selection of work.
* Create connections and linkages with relevant practitioners, organizations, and institutions in students’ field(s) of interest, with an attention to identifying key figures as well as situating their own work within these fields.
* Demonstrate the ability to think, speak, and write clearly and effectively with regard to the creative and/or scholarly practice

##### ADDITIONAL COURSE GOALS
* Understand and critique the structure of the internet and its networks.
* Think nonlinearly through hypermedia and code.
Creatively deploy HTML, CSS and Javascript to create art on/for the web and with the web.
* Build a critical framework for discussing your work in the wider context of internet art, net.art.

### ASSIGNMENTS
The course will include workshops and several short-term projects, a long-term project, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written responses, and technical research. The assignments are designed to broaden and deepen understanding of the technical tools, as well as provide space to apply them towards aesthetic and artistic exploration.
