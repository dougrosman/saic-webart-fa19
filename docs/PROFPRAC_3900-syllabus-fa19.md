### COURSE DESCRIPTION
**_Professional Practice: Web Art_** is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of web art. Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well as additional languages like CSS and Javascript to build varied websites. Potential overall format and conceptual frameworks for developing a media-rich website will be investigated, and ways of subverting the traditional web page format in order to create unique approaches to the dynamics of the web will be explored. Course activities include technical tutorials, preparing a résumé and CV, writing a project statement, creating a website, and critiquing projects.

### Course Materials
* A computer that can connect to the internet
* Atom -a text editor– atom.io
* Github desktop client

* Demonstrate the ability to think, speak, and write clearly and effectively with regard to the creative and/or scholarly practice

##### ADDITIONAL COURSE GOALS

### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:
SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule an appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you with a letter outlining the approved accommodations for you to deliver to your instructors. This letter must be presented before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC is located within the Wellness Center on the 13th floor of 116 S Michigan Ave. and can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

### ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT:
From the SAIC Student Handbook:
“Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of recommendation. Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite locations and online education.
Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning. It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP authentication, to verify student identity.”
Additional resources for students:
* Read “Plagiarism: How to Recognize It and Avoid It: a short guide prepared by the Faculty Senate Student Life Subcommittee in 2004.
* Read the Flaxman Library’s quick guide titled “When to give credit.”

### ATTENDANCE
SAIC policy states that students are expected to attend all classes regularly and on time. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. It is the instructor’s responsibility to give this information to the student as his/her/their schedule permits. Missing class for other than a reasonable cause may jeopardize the student’s academic standing in the class. Attendance is required on the two final critique days to receive credit for this course.
<br>

If a student misses MORE than three classes, whether or not for a reasonable cause, the student will fail the class, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade  of "W."<br>

__Deadline for withdrawal:__ Fall 2019 semester: Tuesday, October 29, 2019
##### Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
* Illness or hospitalization (the student should also contact Health Services or their academic advisor, who will relay information to
the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
* Family illness or death (the student should also contact their academic advisor, who can relay information to all faculty)
* Observation of a religious holiday (students are expected to notify their instructors in advance to discuss reasonable
accommodations for holidays they might observe). <br>

Show your faculty//classmates respect by coming to class on time every day and turning in all assignments.
