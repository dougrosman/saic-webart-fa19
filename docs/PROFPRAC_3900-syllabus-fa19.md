### COURSE DESCRIPTION
**_Professional Practice: Web Art_** is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of web art. Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well as additional languages like CSS and Javascript to build varied websites. Potential overall format and conceptual frameworks for developing a media-rich website will be investigated, and ways of subverting the traditional web page format in order to create unique approaches to the dynamics of the web will be explored. Course activities include technical tutorials, preparing a résumé and CV, writing a project statement, creating a website, and critiquing projects.

### COURSE GOALS
##### KEY GOALS INCLUDE:
* Implement a well-planned creative project, applying professional skills relevant to your artistic, creative, and/or scholarly practice.
* Present a professional body of work in an online context, demonstrating a critical awareness of audience and selection of work.
* Create connections and linkages with relevant practitioners, organizations, and institutions in students’ field(s) of interest, with an attention to identifying key figures as well as situating their own work within these fields.
* Demonstrate the ability to think, speak, and write clearly and effectively with regard to the creative and/or scholarly practice

##### ADDITIONAL COURSE GOALS
* Understand and critique the structure of the internet and its networks.
* Think nonlinearly through hypermedia and code.
Creatively deploy HTML, CSS and Javascript to create art on/for the web and with the web.
* Build a critical framework for discussing your work in the wider context of internet art, net.art.

### ASSIGNMENTS
The course will include workshops and several short-term projects, a long-term project, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written responses, and technical research. The assignments are designed to broaden and deepen understanding of the technical tools, as well as provide space to apply them towards aesthetic and artistic exploration.

Assignments for each week will be listed at the end of each session's schedule. __Readings and assignments should be completed by the following session__, unless otherwise noted.

Policies Student Attendance
SAIC policy states that students are expected to attend all classes regularly and on time. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. It is the instructor’s responsibility to give this information to the student as his/her/their schedule permits. Missing class for other than a reasonable cause may jeopardize the student’s academic standing in the class.
SAIC’s recommended institutional policy is as follows: If a student misses MORE than three classes, whether or not for a reasonable cause, the student will fail the class, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade of "W."
Deadline for withdrawal: Fall 2017 semester: Tuesday, October 31, 2017. Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
•	Illness or hospitalization (the student should also contact Health Services or their academic advisor, who will relay information to the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
•	Family illness or death (the student should also contact their academic advisor, who can relay information to all faculty)
•	Observation of a religious holiday (students are expected to notify their instructors in advance to discuss reasonable accommodations for holidays they might observe).
Academic Misconduct:
From the SAIC Student Handbook:
“Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite locations and online education.
Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning. It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place that protect student privacy and uses LDAP authentication to verify student identity.”
Specific procedures for faculty to follow in the case of academic misconduct are detailed in the Student Handbook.
Additional resources for students:
•	Read “Plagiarism: How to Recognize It and Avoid It: a short guide prepared by the Faculty Senate Student Life Subcommittee in 2004.
•	Read the Flaxman Library’s quick guide titled “AVOID PLAGIARISM.” Accommodations Statement:
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a
Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule an appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you with a letter outlining the approved accommodations for you to deliver to your instructors. This letter must be presented before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible.
