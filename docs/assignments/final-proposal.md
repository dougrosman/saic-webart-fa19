### Assignment Description

The final project for this class is open-ended, and meant to be an opportunity for you to make the work you want to make. You can choose to build on your midterm assignment and complete your artist website, or create a new project that pushes you to develop your skills in web development.
<br>
For your final proposal, create an outline/sketch of what you're planning on doing. Include whatever writing or images you would like in order to communicate your idea.
<br>
In addition to your sketch/outline, please answer ALL of the following questions:

1. What is your goal with this project?
1. Why is that your goal?
1. Think about achieving your project on a technical level:
    1. Can you break down the technical challenges you're facing into smaller, more manageable steps?
    1. What do you think the difficult part of your final will be? Is it more about managing your time to achieve what you already know at a larger scale? Or is it more a matter of wanting to learn something new, and not being quite sure where to begin?
1. What are some web-related topics you would be interested in learning? (Your answers don't have to relate directly to your final)
