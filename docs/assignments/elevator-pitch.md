### Assignment Summary

The "elevator pitch" is a (typically) 60-90 second summary of something–a summary meant to sell an idea or give someone the gist of something as succinctly as possible. The phrase "elevator pitch" considers the following the scenario: what if you happened to be in an elevator with an incredibly important person who should really hear what you have to say? After all, they are sort of <em>forced</em> to listen to you if you're trapped in there together. How do you make the most out of that time?
<br>
The time you have depends on the elevator you're in. Here are some elevator timing facts to consider.*

* The Burj Khalifa in Dubai: The tallest building in the world; takes <strong>1 minute</strong> to reach the 124th floor.
* The Willis Tower in Chicago: takes <strong> 90 seconds </strong> to reach the 103rd floor.
* MacLean elevators at 8:55am on a Monday in week 2 of the semester: <strong>10 minutes</strong> to reach the 12th floor. (Note, a 10-minute elevator pitch is arguably no longer an elevator pitch, even if you're in an elevator).
* There's always the emergency stop mechanism if you need more time.

*<i>Most elevator pitches don't take place in elevators</i>

### Assignment Guidelines

In your case, your "elevator pitch" is describing who you are and what you do as an artist. I'm sure we've all struggled at one point or another to distill who we are and what we do in just a few beautiful sentences to our family, or friends, or prospective employers–maybe even to ourselves!

For this exercise, come to class with a 60-90 second summary of who you are as an artist, designer, or however you self-identify as a creative person. Think of it as a mini-artist statement. Or don't, if you hate that.

#### Some things to guide you:

1. What media/materials do you work with? (E.g., "My practice is very interdisciplinary, but I primarily work as a sculptor and photographer" etc.)
1. You can talk about what you can do/have done, as well as what you _want_ to do/are working towards (E.g, "I've been studying all aspects of game design for the last few years, including designing gameplay, crafting narratives, and building visuals and audio. I am currently working towards specializing in character animation.")
1. Think about broadly describing your skills at first, and then talk a bit about a specific project you've done that clarifies how you've put your skills to use.
1. Do you have a a favorite quote by anyone? (not required! but sometimes a good quote can help summarize how you think about what you do.)
1. In addition to the _whats_ and _hows_ of your practice, don't forget the _why_: why do you do the things you do? (that's a big question, of course, but giving 10 seconds to the _why_ can go a long way.)

##### Some DON'TS
1. Don't list off a bunch of software/tools that you use. After your pitch, someone might ask you what tools you like to use, and that's the perfect time to say how much you dislike Javascript but love Max MSP. But until they ask, focus on what you do with your tools, not what they are. (okay, maybe don't lead with what you dislike, but sometimes that's a fun conversation.)
1. Don't be too technical or specific with what you do. This depends a bit on your audience (are they artists or tech people, etc.), but your pitch should be as general as possible. When people ask questions, _then_ you can get specific.
1. Don't rely on props: it's very tempting to pull out our phones and show images or video of work we've done, or play sound clips. There is a time for that–after the pitch!


### In class on Wednesday:

We'll do an in-class workshop where we do our pitches for each other, so come prepared to do this without a script! A piece of paper with a couple bullet points is fine, but not a word-for-word script! We'll start out practicing and giving feedback in pairs, and then take turns performing our pitches for the whole class. Let's have fun with this!

#### Final note:
It might feel awkward at first, like you might think to yourself, "when is it appropriate to word-vomit at someone for a whole minute about what I do?" In addition to the pitch, we'll also discuss ways to organically/dynamically/naturally fit it into a conversation you're having with someone. Don't worry about that for the homework though, just work on your pitch!
