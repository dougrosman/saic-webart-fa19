### Assignment Description:
The __'artist website'__ is an incredibly useful thing to have in your repertoire as an artist. It's a place to display documentation of your work, and tell the world a little bit about who you are. But the 'artist website' doesn't have to just an empty container for your portfolio; it can be an expressive medium in and of itself.

For this assignment, you will be crafting your artist website. Your site should be hybridic in nature: part art work, part portfolio. How can the layout/design/aesthetic of your website be an extension of you and your practice?

We are still most of us new to web development, so the dreams we have for our beautiful websites might not align with our technical skills (yet). I encourage you to think beyond the limitations of your abilities when sketching it out! You can always plan to include features in the future once you learn a bit more. I'll be working with each of you individually to find a scope for this project that works for you.

_**If you DON'T already have an artist website...**_
Great! You get to build your site from scratch! Even if you're early in your career as an artist and don't have a ton of works to show yet, that's okay! It'll be great to have a website ready and waiting for when you do have some work.

_**If you DO already have an artist website...**_
Great! This assignment can go one of three ways:
1. **Total revamp:** maybe you're ready for a totally new approach to your website, and you're down to start from scratch. Awesome.
1. **Updating what you already have:** if you've already been building a website for yourself from scratch already, what's a way you can expand on it with things we've learned in class so far?
1. **Building a second site:** If you're using a website building platform like Wordpress/Wix/Squarespace/Tumblr/etc., creating a website with those tools is a lot different from building your own site from scratch. For this assignment, experiment with building a site that is much different from the site you already have. (if you fall into this category, we'll definitely figure out a course of action in our one-on-one meetings on either 10/7 or 10/9).

#### Guidelines+Requirements
This is largely an open-ended assignment: make an artist website that suits you! That said, there are some baseline requirements:

1. Include at least one HTML file, one CSS style sheet, and one Javascript file.
1. Include at least **three** works from your portfolio. If you don't know which three, use assignments from this class if you'd like!
1. Include a bio and artist statement. We'll have a day dedicated to those later in the semester, but include some early versions of them on your site.

##### Final thoughts:
This assignment is as much a chance to deepen your understanding of front-end web development as it is a chance to build a tool that may follow you for the rest of your artistic career (as long as the internet is still a thing!). The site you create for this assignment is not meant to be a "finished" work, but a well-considered foundation for ongoing project.

### Due Monday (10/07):


##### Midterm prep: Create a "site-map" on paper of your artist website.
Think of this as a sketch of your website. What's the content, how is it structured? etc. It can be tempting to just sit with an empty HTML/CSS page and start "_coding._" Sometimes that's a good way to figure things out. But for more involved coding projects (and any involved project, for that matter), thinking through and planning your project before writing a single line of code can save you from some headaches later on.

Here are some questions to guide you in writing your sketch. Think about your artist website not just as a place to put your work, but as an extension of your practice. Think of creating a website to hold your work is kind of like decorating your home...

1. What is the overall structure? Is your site a single-page that contains everything? Or are things organized into pages? Does it feel more scroll-y or click-y?
2. What do you want to share with people? Finished works only? A work-in-progress page? An experiments page? A blog?
3. Is it easy for people to find what they're looking for? Do you want it to be that way?

##### Here's a content-to-include checklist (some might be optional depending on how you structure your site)
1. Art Works (documentation/information about art works)
1. A directory for finding your work.
1. Artist Statement
1. Bio
1. CV
1. Résumé
1. Writing samples
1. Sketches/experiments
1. Blog/news feed/updates page.
