### Due Monday () (10/09):


##### Midterm prep: Create a "site-map" on paper of your artist website.
Think of this as a sketch of your website. What's the content, how is it structured? etc. It can be tempting to just sit with an empty HTML/CSS page and start "_coding._" Sometimes that's a good way to figure things out. But for more involved coding projects (and any involved project, for that matter), thinking through and planning your project before writing a single line of code can save you from some nasty headaches later on.

Here are some questions to guide you in writing your sketch. Think about your artist website not just as a place to put your work, but as an extension of your practice. Think of creating a website to hold your work is kind of like decorating your home...

1. What is the overall structure? Is your site a single-page that contains everything? Or are things organized into pages? Does it feel more scroll-y or click-y?
2. What do you want to share with people? Finished works only? A work-in-progress page? An experiments page? A blog?
3. Is it easy for people to find what they're looking for? Do you want it to be that way?

##### Here's a content-to-include checklist (some might be optional depending on how you structure your site)
1. Art Works (documentation/information about art works)
1. A directory for finding your work.
1. Artist Statement
1. Bio
1. CV
1. Résumé
1. Writing samples
1. Sketches/experiments
1. Blog/news feed/updates page.
