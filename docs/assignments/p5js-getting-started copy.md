### Assignment Description:
It's time to dive in to p5.js! <a href="https://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5.js</a> is an awesome creative-coding <i>library</i> that makes it easy to make generative and interactive sound and visual works directly in the browser.

While it's super easy to just dive in and start experimenting with p5.js code in their slick web-editor (<a href="https://editor.p5js.org" target="_blank">here</a>), there are a few extra steps you have to do to incorporate a p5.js sketch directly into your website. For Monday, I want you to be familiar with creating a p5.js sketch and including it in a web page. Then, I want you to play around with the code a little bit, see what you can make! The goal is that we can dive into p5 right away without spending too much time on all the setup! 

#### Guidelines+Requirements

1. Go to the p5.js <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started" target="_blank">Get Started</a> page and follow the instructions for setting up a sketch.
    1. Note 1: it will mention two ways of doing this: 1. Downloading the p5 files, and 2. Linking to them from a CDN. For this assignment, I want you to <strong>download the p5.js files</strong>
    1. Note 2: In the setup example, they use a text editor called "Sublime Text." You can do everything they say to do in VS Code.
1. Draw something (a circle, a rectangle, etc. Doesn't have to be fancy!) in your p5.js sketch, and make sure you can actually see it on a web page in a browser! (you don't have to push it to your GitHub, just make sure it works in your Live Server)
1. When you arrive to class on Monday, the first thing you should do is open up your web page with your p5 sketch.

__In summary: Create a web page with a p5.js sketch. Draw something simple in your p5.js sketch. Display your web page on your computer when you arrive in class on Monday.__
