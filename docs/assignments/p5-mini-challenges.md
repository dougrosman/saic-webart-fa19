### Assignment Description:
Practice some p5.js code!

1. Create an account on <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="blank">editor.p5js.org</a> so you can save your sketches!
1. Attempt to recreate the following 3 images and one animation with p5.js code!

(my canvas dimensions are 400, 400)

![p5-00](images/p5-00.png)
sketch 00 <br>

![p5-01](images/p5-01.png)
sketch 01 <br>

![p5-02](images/p5-02.png)
sketch 02 <br>

![p5-03](images/p5-03.gif)
sketch 03
(the gif is slightly distorted, the circles should just be circles!) <br>


We'll go over the code in class on Wednesday 10/30. Don't worry if you get stuck, just try your best! <br>

Tip: if you're struggling with the code, try first describing the images in plain english, and then see if you can translate that into code.
