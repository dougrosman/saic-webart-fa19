                  <p>I only have today to explore, but I decided to start out today with a walk by the lake.  We're in the dues apparently. The beaches during this time of year have a particualr look to them, it's kind of odd i'm not going to lie. seeing white-sand beaches but needing to bundle up like a burrito </p>

                      <p><p>I met someone really cool today; she&rsquo;s the daughter of the owner of the BnB I'm staying at. Her name is Sam. Apparently, she does some work on the grounds and has read some of my blogs before I came.&nbsp; She said she&rsquo;s going to show me around town and some of her favorite spots. She seems to be on the level with what I like, and like a really cool person in general.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s pretty off the grid, or I would post her socials.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>I cannot wait to go on this new adventure!</p></p>
