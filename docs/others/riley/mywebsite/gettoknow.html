            <div id="overflow"><h2>artist statement </h2><br><p> <p>Art is complicated, fine art, even more so. With hoops and hundreds of years of history to jump through, it is no surprise that layman wants little to nothing to do with the art world. Though these people who exist outside of the art world, are possibly the ones who need it the most. My art is trying to bridge the gap between the vast spaces of the world of fine art and those who have no connection to it. Through my art, I want to inspire others to create something of their own. Whether it be writing drawing or sculpture, if one of my work inspires someone else to go out and make something, I will have considered my work a success.</p>
              <p>Many people are talking about may things through their art, whether it be deep political or themes of self-discovery, my work is about the in-between space, about the communication or better yet the lack thereof. How every group is self-isolating to some extent, and othering is repent in the world. I hope through my encouragement of creation, and my more personally charged works inspire empathy over anything else.&nbsp; Because to inspire compassion for something that may not have existed may make it easier to step into someone else&rsquo;s real shoes.</p>
              <p>My wide virality of works celebrates these aspects through experimentation; the what-if did something strange with this material and combined it with something else. Sometimes my works are more about this experimentation than the finished product though this usually does not help my goal of inspiring empathy or creativity it feeds my curiosity witch I strive to supply at all times.</p> </p>
